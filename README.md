# MOK Project - Multilingual Onscreen Keyboard
The goal of this project is to materialize a well-styled, onscreen keyboard capable of supporting numerous languages fed from .klc files generated by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This has proven to be the most-reliable source of unicode data but I am willing to make revisions if a better source is found. Typical use cases for this application include terminals and other touch-point devices.

## Installation / Running

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Update npm to the latest version.

```sh
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```

Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or your own prefered server.

```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd /mok-project
$ http-server
```

_Feel free to disregard these instructions if you have your own preferred server package._

##### Prerequisites / Dependencies

This project was built on jQuery 3.2 and is fed .klc files from Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator V1.4.

## Usage

To initiate a global instance of the keyboard within your application you may include the following script:

```sh
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $(document).keyboard();
    });
</script>
```

Appending the keyboard to a specific element/class/ID will create a listener for all input[type="text"] fields at that element level and all child elements unless the singleInstance option has been set:

```sh
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('div').keyboard();
        $('.my-div-class').keyboard();
        $('#my-div-id').keyboard();
    });
</script>
```

If you would like to initiate an instance on a specific element you may include the following script:

```sh
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $(your_element).keyboard({
            'singleInstance': true
        });
    });
</script>
```

## Options

| Option | Default Value | Information |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| singleInstance | false | Initialize a single instance or globalize. |

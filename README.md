# MOK Project - Multilingual Onscreen Keyboard
The goal of this project is to materialize a well-styled, onscreen keyboard capable of supporting numerous languages fed from .klc files generated by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This has proven to be the most-reliable source of unicode data but I am willing to make revisions if a better source is found. Typical use cases for this application include terminals and other touch-point devices.

## Installation / Running

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Update npm to the latest version.

```sh
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```

Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or your own prefered server.

```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd /mok-project
$ http-server
```

_Feel free to disregard these instructions if you have your own preferred server package._

# MOK Project - Multilingual Onscreen Keyboard
The goal of this project is to materialize a well-styled, onscreen keyboard capable of supporting numerous languages fed from .klc files generated by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This has proven to be the most-reliable source of unicode data but I am willing to make revisions if a better source is found. Typical use cases for this application include terminals and other touch-point devices.

## Installation / Running

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Update npm to the latest version.

```sh
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```

Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or your own prefered server.

```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd /mok-project
$ http-server
```

_Feel free to disregard these instructions if you have your own preferred server package._

#### Prerequisites / Dependencies

This project was built and tested on jQuery 3.2 and is fed .klc files from [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) V1.4.

## Usage

To initiate an instance of the keyboard within your application you may include the following script:

```sh
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $(document).keyboard({
            language: 'us',
            keyboardPosition: 'bottom'
        });
    });
</script>
```

## Bugs / Drawbacks

I'm not certain if ligature support is fully functioning for keyboards such as Hindi, Punjabi, Arabic, etc... I need your help in verifying these layouts! I do not speak these languages and I've found keyboard layouts very inconsistent. If you find a keyboard that is not function, I'll be happy to make any revisions needed.

I have not personally tested every keyboard and you may find bugs along your journey. I'll work to quickly resolve any issues you might uncover.

This initial release is not intended to be mobile friendly. It's original scope was intended for those devices such as terminals. It is the intention to provide mobile support at a later time.

Due to the nature of JavaScript / jQuery, I currently do not know of a way to load all keyboard layouts in a directory. You must declare all keyboards which you wish to use.

## Coming Features

* Mobile Options
* Hardware-Keyboard Listeners (Perhaps)
* Number Pad Only Option

# mok-project - Multilingual Onscreen Keyboard
The goal of this project is to materialize a well-styled, onscreen keyboard capable of supporting numerous languages fed from .klc files generated by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This has proven to be the most-reliable source of unicode data but I am willing to make revisions if a better source is found. Typical use cases for this application include terminals and other touch-point devices.
